# 🎓 The Feynman AI Tutor

> Master complex subjects through the power of teaching.

Built for **HACKHAZARDS '26** — **EdTech & Active Learning Track**

## ⚠️ The Problem

Most students rely on passive learning methods such as reading textbooks, highlighting text, and watching lectures.

This often creates the **Illusion of Competence** — the feeling that you understand a topic until exam day arrives and you realize you cannot explain or recall it effectively.

---

## 💡 The Solution

**The Feynman AI Tutor** forces active recall using the famous **Feynman Technique**, a learning method based on explaining concepts in simple language.

Instead of students asking questions to an AI, the AI reads the study material and asks the student questions.

Powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**, the AI acts as a rigorous yet supportive examiner that focuses on genuine understanding rather than memorization.

### Key Learning Flow

#### 📄 Context Ingestion
Upload any PDF, including:

- Lecture slides
- Class notes
- Textbook chapters
- Study guides

The system extracts the content and treats it as the **ground truth** for the learning session.

#### 🎯 Active Interrogation

The AI asks questions such as:

> "Explain this concept as if you're teaching it to a 5-year-old."

This forces students to actively reconstruct knowledge rather than passively recognize it.

#### 🔍 Analogy Generation

When a student struggles, the AI provides intuitive analogies and hints instead of immediately revealing the answer.

#### 📊 Real-Time Mastery Tracking

A dynamic mastery score updates continuously based on the AI's hidden evaluation of the student's explanations.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

### 🗄️ Vector Database Integration (RAG)

Move from local JSON storage to **ChromaDB** to support:

- Massive textbooks
- Research papers
- 500+ page documents
- Long-term semantic retrieval

### 🎙️ Voice-to-Text Learning

Enable students to verbally explain concepts through:

- Speech recognition
- Real-time transcription
- Oral exam simulation
- Hands-free learning sessions

### 📈 Advanced Analytics

Future versions may include:

- Topic-level mastery breakdown
- Learning trend visualization
- Weak-area detection
- Personalized revision plans

---

## 🎯 Why It Works

The Feynman AI Tutor is built on a simple principle:

> **If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.**

By transforming passive study sessions into active teaching exercises, students develop stronger comprehension, better retention, and greater exam confidence.
